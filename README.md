# LatInfLexi

This is an inflected lexicon of Latin verbs and nouns. It includes all the 254 inflected forms (including gerund, gerundive, supine and participles) of 3,348 verbs extracted from Delatte et al.'s (1981) *Dictionnaire frÃ©quentiel et Index inverse de la langue latine*, and all the 12 inflected forms of the 1,038 most frequent nouns in the same resource. The forms have been generated semi-automatically using the database of Lemlat (www.lemlat3.eu).

This is version 2.0. The main change with respect to version 1 is the data format: LatInfLexi is now released in the Paralex standard format for paradigmatic lexicons (https://www.paralex-standard.org/). As a consequence, it is structured as a set of .csv tables following a relational model, and detailed metadata is provided using the frictionless standard (https://frictionlessdata.io/) in the LatInfLexi_package.json file, generated by the script gen-metadata.py.
v2.0 > v2.0.1: 
- added dataset name and ISO 639 code of the language in the metadata;
- minor corrections, particularly regarding stress assignment (details can be retrieved in the code provided, see below).

For the content of tables and columns defined in the Paralex standard, the user is referred to the general documentation provided in the Paralex documentation (https://www.paralex-standard.org/specs/).
Below is some information on the content of columns that are not defined in the Paralex standard, but have been added for the specific need of this dataset.

- In the forms, lexemes and cells table, separate columns are provided to provide information on frequency in the different epochs documented in our source of frequency data - namely, Tombeur's (1998) *Thesaurus Formarum Totius Latinitatis*:
    - frequency_Antiquitas (from the origins to the end of the 2nd century A.D.);
    - frequency_AetasPatrum (2nd century-735 A.D.);
    - frequency_MediumAeuum (736-1499);
    - frequency_RecentiorLatinitas (1500-1965).

- In the sounds table, several columns are used to allow for a definition of each sound in terms of phonological features, whose values can be 1 (when a sound is characterized by the presence of a feature), 0 (when a sound is characterized by the absence of a feature), or an empty string (when a feature is not relevant for a sound).

- In the cells table:
    - in the column cell_romance_aligned, the code used for each cell in the Oxford Online Database of Romance Verb Morphology (http://romverbmorph.clp.ox.ac.uk/) is given.

This repository also contains a piece of code (and associated files) that takes in input the previous release of LatInfLexi (1.1) and applies all the systematic changes that are necessary to generate the forms, cells and lexemes tables of this new version (see the folder LatInfLexi_to_Paralex). The other tables have been created or updated manually whenever necessary.
v2.0 > v2.0.1:
- added code to go from version 2.0 to 2.0.1.
