# LatInfLexi

This is an inflected lexicon of Latin verbs. It includes all the 254 inflected forms (including gerund, gerundive, supine and participles) of 3,348 verbs extracted from Delatte et al.'s (1981) Dictionnaire fr√©quentiel et Index inverse de la langue latine. The forms have been generated semi-automatically using the database of Lemlat (www.lemlat3.eu).

In the first column, there is a univocal identifier of the lexeme to which the form belongs, corresponding to the lemma used in Lemlat. In those rare cases where two or more verbs have the same lemma in Lemlat, a numeric diacritic is added.

In the second column, the paradigm cell occupied by the form is coded using the PoS-tags of the Universal Part-of-Speech Tagset by Petrov et al. (2012), followed by a colon and by a set of values (separated by a +) of the following morphological features, used in Universal Dependencies (http://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html) :

- VerbForm (Fin, Inf, Ger, Gdv, Part, Sup);
- Mood (Ind, Sub, Imp);
- Tense (Pres, Imp, Fut, Past, Pqp);
- Aspect (Imp, Perf);
- Voice (Act, Pass);
- Person (1, 2, 3);
- Number (Sing, Plur);
- Case (Nom, Gen, Dat, Acc, Voc, Abl);
- Gender (Masc, Fem, Neut).

In the third column, the form itself is reported. Defective cells are marked as #DEF#.

The remaining columns provide information on the form's frequency, taken from Tombeur's (1998) Thesaurus Formarum Totius Latinitatis, reporting the total number of occurrences as well as data divided in four different epochs:

- Antiquitas (from the origins to the end of the 2nd century A.D.);
- Aetas Patrum (2nd century-735 A.D.);
- Medium Aeuum (736-1499);
- Recentior Latinitas (1500-1965).
